# Heart Runner
> From "Measuring Physical Activity Levels during Instructional Settings from Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder" research, conducted by Melissa Bittner, Ralph Rozenek, Barry Lavay, and B. Rhett Rigby, a need to capture and improve heart rate and energy expenditure for children with disabilities arose. Many children with autism spectrum disorder, "may not possess the skills needed to by physically active and participate in sport and recreational activities in their local school or community." (Bittner). The solution to this problem is an application that will be developed to monitor the heart rates of children with autism spectrum disorder. Based on the child heart rate during the exercise the application will illustrate whether the child's heart rate is at the appropriate level. Again based on the values, the application will encourage/discourage the children to actively engage/disengage in exercise that will get their heart rate above 70% of their heart rate maximum. The application will keep track of the children’s heart rate levels per exercise routine and record said data to analyze the children’s overall heart rate and energy expenditure to help improve the heart rate for these children.
